We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements. For example, we may lengthen the retention period for some data if needed to comply with law or voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to free up storage space.</p>
<p class="text-left">Management of User Information: You can access and manage your account information. You can update your usage by accessing further paid services or products, or change details such as email address, and personal information.</p>
